# Build a Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

Group project from meetup 2 on Technigo Bootcamp

Object was to fetch information from an API to build a food review site using JavaScript.

If I had more time I would make the images clickable and the reviews put on a different page, and work a bit on styling.
